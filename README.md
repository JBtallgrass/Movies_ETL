This project was focused on building a Database. This week's assignment was one of the harder ones since I had trouble loading one of the Modules- thought I could fix it but was unable to determine the error. 

## Purpose
The objective of the assignment was to develop a pipeline that continual updates to provide current information for movie-goers. The development of the project began with taking raw data and cleaning it into a usable data source once extracted from the origninal raw data. The transformation process was labor intensive and easily distracted- I began by reviewing the raw data and then mapping out- analog- a plan before I started.  Once complete the assignment required loading the database (merged) and then performing a test query.

## Results
The assignment was a challenge- multiple platforms, multiple languages and continual reworking until I got the school solution- sorry no pictures today!!!! The inability to import Psycopg2 really unsettled the process.
